# 🏠 House Price Prediction (California Housing Dataset)

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts house prices in California using machine learning.  
It follows a full end-to-end ML workflow — from **data exploration** to **model deployment** — using Python in **Google Colab**.

**Dataset:** [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)  
**Source:** Kaggle  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Explore and visualize California housing data.  
- Preprocess data for modeling (handle missing values, encode, scale).  
- Train multiple regression models to predict housing prices.  
- Tune and evaluate the best-performing model.  
- Save and version the model for future predictions.
